We present before you the Pharmaport website. (we care, for your health)
Business plan
the website provides the facility to store all the medical records like prescriptions given by doctors, scanned copies of X-rays, CT-scan, MRI and everything related to reports of a person from birth to present in digital format.

## Example
***Let us see an example to make the idea clear :
Murali, a 25 year old boy, has a skin problem, so he booked an appointment and went to Apollo hospital. The receptionist takes his phone number and a unique code generated by our website. The receptionist gives the details of murali along with unique code of respective doctor to authorisation service. Which in turn connects the doctor and patient by giving the doctor access to patients medical records on successful verification. Now when the doctor is about to prescribe medicines he fills in a form along with timelines. Now muralis website account is updated with prescriptions and test reports given by the doctor. Murali can also rate the doctors and give feedback to the hospital services.

I hope the example shows how helpful was Pharmaport to murali
